# What is kutenq!

**kutenq!** is a recipe manager, but it's not just any other recipe manager. **kutenq!**'s main goal is _*translatability*_.

With the internet, we may think we have an unlimited treasure trove of recipies and resources, from every culture and nation imaginable, right at our fingertips. That simply isn't the case. We are still bound by language barriers, only being able to access what is written to us in our language of understanding. **kutenq!** hopes to solve that issue.

With **kutenq!** recipes aren't stores as text, they're stored as individual components. When it's time to view a recipe, **kutenq!** will combine these components and generate a recipe in your language and units of choice, without anyone having to manually translate it.

# What does "kutenq" mean?

**kutenq** is a transliteration of the Armenian word, **կուտենք**. Depending on how it is used in a sentance, it can mean "let's eat" or "we will eat..."

Both definitions are fitting for what **kutenq!** aspires to be.
